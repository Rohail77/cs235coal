# Assignments & Semester Project


## Guidelines:
The following assignments are meant for individual students. Although we encourage peer discussion and learning, sharing of assignment among peers are not allowed (You are going to need a better excuse than Sir. we did the assignment together). Every student is responsible for protecting the solution of his/her assignment.  

+ Assignment No. # 1: **Due date: 8th November 2020**
Understand the working of circuit diagram and coding for the Tutorials[0-15]/Examples given on the “tinkercad” website.

# BSCS9C : Class code = ------

**Assessment:** After the completion of the assignment 1, the students will be assessed based on their understanding of the hardware and the code using viva or quiz or practical demo.

+ Assignment No. # 2: **22nd November 2020**
Perform a survey for the following Bus protocols in order to develop a complete understanding of these protocols. 

+ SPI
+ I2C (IIC)

**Assessment:** After the completion of assignment 2, Students will be assessed based on their understanding of the protocols (wiring diagram and coding).

+ Assignment No. # 3: Deadline: **6th December 2020**
Implement 3 examples learnt in assignment 1 & 2 on hardware esp8266 dev board.
You can buy esp8266 and supporting hardware online from these websites individually or as a group (you can buy from anywhere in pakistan I have just provided some options.). (The hardware cost for each student shouldn’t exceed from PKR 1000 for project and assignments. You can replace actuators (like motors etc) with simple LEDs to show us the results.)

> Semester Project: **Deadline: 31st December 2020**
(3-5 Member groups): Each member will be assessed individually although team work will also be assessed. The difficulty of the project should be according to the number of students in the group. Every Member should have an understanding of the working of the project and the technical knowledge. 

+ Design a project that is performing some meaningful operations (some examples are given below).
+ Deploy a websocket for collection of sensor data and controlling actuators
+ Deploy mesh network using multiple ESP8266 boards ()
+ Host & Deploy a website (HTML page) on ESP8266 for status of sensors and control button 
+ Any other Project of your choice.
